* [Database] Postgres or MongoDB depending on our needs
   * My preference is Postgres so we are sql based (most experienced)
   * Performance should not be an issue
* [Backend Application Server] Flask
   * Minimalistic python web framework
   * http://flask.pocoo.org/
   * I already have experience with it, so it will be no problem
   * Database Plugins
      * Postgres - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-sqlalchemy/
      * Mongo - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask-mongoengine/
* [Web server / Static File host / WSGI Proxy] Nginx
   * self explanatory, basically a one time setup
* [Front end]
   * [Project Scaffolding] Ionic
      * http://ionicframework.com/
      * Ionic provides project scaffolding for a project using bower, grunt, and apache cordova (the secret sauce to deploying as mobile) https://cordova.apache.org/
   * [MVC] Angular.js
      * Built into ionic, but is the core framework for the app
   * [Frontend Framework] Ionic
      * Mobile-optimized html, css, and javascript. Looks kind of like ios 7 by default


This stack will allow for us to deploy as a web app, and as mobile using the same code
